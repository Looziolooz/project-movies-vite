# Movie Site Project
For this assigment I built a movie site with React Router, fetching the data from a movie data base.



The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

Had a lot of trouble when deploying the site in Netlify.
